If you said x86 is king of datacenter computing then I agree. But embedded counts as computing. If we are just talking raw processor counts across all computing then it’s ARM.  And the momentum shift is clear.

The cost effectiveness is a side effect of treating servers as disposable. Resiliency was the initial driver not cost. It just turns out those two are linked in the cloud model.

Lastly, if you stop and think about it, 3D is an absolutely TERRIBLE interface for so much stuff. Really. It’s just awful. So as currently realized The Metaverse is a weak sauce overlay of walled gardens on top of the Internet that adds questionable value. MMORPGs v2.0!"

It’s all so rich you have to distribute the sauces into the rice or it’s too much. Very difficult to separate much of the food from the rice. In fact there is a word 4 food that goes with rice (ulam) and foo that doesn’t (pulutan).

If luck wasn’t involved then failure rates wouldn’t be so high. Also your position in the VC ecosystem reinforces your success. It’s a LOT more luck than people think.

Very little VC value is in their investment selection. If there is any value it’s in helping right the ship when it goes sideways.

Invoking Soviet Union era Marxist terminology is dumb. Even if it’s accurate. The problem is you drive the division deeper. Polarization helps no one. The poor rural proletariat exists.
