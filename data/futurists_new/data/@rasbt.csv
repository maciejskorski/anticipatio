TabDDPM uses multinomial diffusion for categorical (and binary) features — adding uniform noise.

For numerical features, it uses the common Gaussian diffusion.

The reverse diffusion process is learned via a fully connected network (MLP) https://t.co/A8Nk1K3i3Z"

I.e., instead of splitting the training set into multiple folds, you split the training set into a training + validation set. To me splitting the training set via CV or into a validation set is the same thing in terms of leakage."

There is definitely some barrier of entry (extra effort), esp. compared to just having a folder of labeled images for which you e.g. create a PyTorch dataset class but I can see how it can be useful for reproducible research. Thanks for sharing!"

Also, I sometimes find interesting articles via social media. Other than that, I use Google Scholar."
