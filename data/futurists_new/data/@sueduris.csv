What would energize them to take action on your post? Use the personality elements that drew them to you in the first place. That really is the key. #CMWorld

But do what they expect. Otherwise you give an inconsistent experience and that's where trust starts to wane. Recommend consistency across channels. #CMWorld #CX.
