Recognize the power of following, too, and honor it. *That* is #leadership."

Communicate the actions you’ve taken. Close the loop. 

It’s annoying to be asked for feedback 50 times + never know what you did with feedback last time.

A few months ago a survey came out on how negative delivery experiences impact customers’ impression of a brand. It may not be the brand's fault, but at some point, you start questioning the quality of your delivery partners. #CX

I'd argue that yes, the skills are somewhat different for the practice of #CX in #B2B versus B2C. Example: customer feedback. In B2B, human-to-human relationships + RFPs still rule. Collecting feedback usually needs to take on a more human touch than a survey."

If you're dedicating a budget to marketing and #demand generation, but haven't smoothed out the experience you're leading #customers to, then you're not ""doing CX."" #CustServ #cx"
