Those of you who think thoughtful politics for the people isn‚Äôt possible in places like Montana:

1) quit that shit
2) give the guy a follow"

Here it‚Äôs called State Auditor, but that position gets to decide, for instance, if predatory ‚Äújunk insurance‚Äù gets to be sold to working families or if it‚Äôs banned on a statewide basis."

I cannot emphasize enough the importance of hyper local races like county commissioner, etc - or even statewide Tier Bs like Insurance Commissioner, Secretary of State, or AG."

Happy New Year fellow Dems! üéâ"
