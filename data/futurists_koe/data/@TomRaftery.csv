EV batteries lose around 1% of capacity every 30,000km driven, and so after 600,000 km they are still at 80%.
If the battery was 80kWh, it still has 64kWh usable.
A home battery from Tesla is 14kWh.
And batteries are 100% recyclable"

Like.
Right now green hydrogen is an expensive wasteful pipe dream and the reasons it is expensive and inefficient are down to physics. Economies of scale don’t help here. The opposite."

Ask @AukeHoekstra - if you do a full lifecycle analysis of EVs vs ICE vehicles, EVs win on total emissions after they have driven 17k km.
In my case my EV was manufactured using renewable energy, and is powered by renewable energy so it wins sooner"
