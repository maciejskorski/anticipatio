Personalization is easy to say and extremely difficult to get right. In some cases, it's ""persona-lization"" where I'm grouped with a cohort. In most, it's adding ""Just for you"" to the usual marketing verbiage.

Fair question, but for me, the copout is saying “This is the right way.” That assumes that it’s easy, it’s universal, and there is only one right way. “It depends” by itself can be a copout. “It depends” in the context of other questions (On what? When? How?) is not."

Hi, Jenny - A great example of this is LL Bean. The culture (since 1912) has been fpcused on the customer and this carries over to internal dealings as well. They have employees treat each other with the same determination, courtesy, and respect as they do customers."

1) Start by modeling the behavior (share knowledge)
2) Understand and communicate the value (knowledge sharing breaks silos, speeds communication, increases cohesion, speeds onboarding, etc.)"

1) A chatbot should not lead customers down a path with no exit. Give customers a way to easily contact a human.
2) Start with your *real* frequently asked questions, pulled from actual cases, not made up internally.
3) Be prepared to update continually.
