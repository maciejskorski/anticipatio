Had some fun producing this with some new animations:

Really helps clear the mind to never be checking things while walking/cooking/etc"

As my own first step, when I got my phone replaced in November, I decided it's only going to be phone+text+GPS+camera, nothing else, and phone/text notifications are always off, rarely respond to them (or even check them) within 24hrs."
