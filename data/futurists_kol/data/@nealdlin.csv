If I've called 100 companies this past year for service, over 80 have deafeningly loud hold music.

When I tell the rep, they all say ""I get that feedback everyday"".

It's not always solving big stuff...sometimes it's tending to all the little easy things."

Add cust behaviour data for implicit feedback. Shadow cust facing teams (#CustomerService for eg.) for key context.

Even the word customer doesn't matters if someone naturally cares for people, it informs their thinking."

A bank I deal with had ""how can I make your day better"" as QM criteria. It seemed sweet the first time but disingenuous each subsequent call. Especially after a dropped call (yikes). Be real is sage advice."

I have found words are less important than tone (warm, positive), energy &amp; intention. Customers want to feel the person is confident, friendly, approachable and truly there to help. Tone and energy go farther than any words could."

Sadly more bad advice than good. A leader once said we don't need to collect or analyze VoC data. He said Steve Jobs never asked customers what they wanted because they don't know. Somehow he took a quote about innovation and concluded that no customer data mattered. :o

I often talk with leaders about something I call Coyote Syndrome. Wile E Coyote jumped from Acme product to product. His execution was poor. He never analyzed or iterated. He abandoned each tool immediately. Execution and measurement would have caught that road runner!

My tip is to avoid the trappings of a very black and white QA process.  Makes it easier to score and train but much harder to adjust to different call types and caller personas.  Embrace the grey!  Calibrate often.  :)
