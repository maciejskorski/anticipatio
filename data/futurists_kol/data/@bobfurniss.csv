Probably a simple answer to a complex question - but here goes: Show interest in what they learned. Offer them the chance to share their learning with others on the team. Challenge them to set goals based on the training and ask if you can hold them accountable."

If the most important thing is listening (see A2), the second is responding to their concerns. Communication during tough-times quiets fears and lets your team know you understand. It has been a tough year. Ask them often, ""how are we doing?"""

Listening must come first in a successful organizational culture. As leaders, unless we know where we are, how will we know where we are going. Employee surveys, walking the floor (MBWA - management by walking around), personal conversations."
