But for such a situation: Imho exceptions should be exceptional and code may regularly fail to deliver an optional (or std::expected in the future) is more appropriate.

We can do the same thing with __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ and the standard doesn't mandate std::source_location::function_name have any of the info that's being relied on here as far as I know.
