Be transparent. Don’t hide the fact that you’re looking to make money. 

Share the success: Bring members of the community in on the money-making.

And sell AFTER you have established your reputation."

Low-friction engagement (retweeting or liking a post) helps attract newcomers and provides social proof. 

Deep engagement: Building live bridges between members of your community."

Get started finding those first 100 members."
