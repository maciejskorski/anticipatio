That leads to my questions: 

Is there room in the https://t.co/4KBXrSf06j research for addressing what are the drivers &amp; enablers of the Collective Wisdom needed to guide the direction of planetary computation? 

Could an R&amp;D project on enhancing Collective Wisdom qualify?"

You wrote abt the need for ""an intentional, directed and worthwhile planetary-scale¬†terraforming"" and the ""deliberate self-design of sapient"" https://t.co/S4Qv8Kt2Du.

Hi Benjamin @bratton! I treasure your radically novel philosophy of terraforming the Earth. AND reading it left me wondering:

How the computational focus of the Planetary Sapience track could combine w/ R&amp;D related to the original, wisdom-oriented meaning of ""sapience?""
