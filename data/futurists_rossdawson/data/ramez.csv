Of course, it's sometimes not possible to get field assembly down to zero. But minimize it."

If you reduce demand somewhere, emissions go down. If you do it by scaling an alternative, you've made the alternative cheaper, which means even more emissions reductions.

If you squeeze supply a bit, it just gets replaced by supply elsewhere."

I guess one place we diverge is in seeing CA as a major oil producer. In my view 0.4% of global production makes it fairly insignificant.
