turns on unleashing the creative potential of as many people as possible. A stronger Creator Economy and larger Creator middle class is essential to making
that happen."

neighborhoods and communities. The public and non-profit sectors can provide scholarships for less-advantaged Creators."

The vast majority of Creators are motivated by the ability to work on projects they are passionate about and give them a sense of meaning and purpose; that enable them to connect with like-minded others; and allow them more control over their schedules.

“winner-take-all” dynamic of talent-based and celebrity-driven industries."

Digital technologies enable Creators to bypass traditional institutional gatekeepers in the movie, music, publishing, &amp; broadcasting industries. This does not mean that talent holds all the cards. Large corporate gatekeepers &amp; digital platforms remain powerful."

The rise of digitally based Creators and the Creator Economy is accelerating an ongoing shift in the balance of power from large corporations and cultural and artistic gatekeepers to talent brought on the rise of creativity as a productive force and economic engine.

for nearly two-thirds of all global venture capital investment in Creator Economy startups. But such startups can also be found in more than 65 other
cities around the world."

451,Richard_Florida,2022-11-01 16:31:15+00:00,https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida/status/1587482412488990720,"12. Digital Creators number more than 300 million people across nine large nations, including more than 85 million Americans. Roughly 17 million American Creators earned money by selling their digital content as of 2017. 2020, according to recent estimates."

453,Richard_Florida,2022-11-01 16:29:23+00:00,https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida/status/1587481939447103490,10. The Creative Class has grown from around 10 or 15 percent of the U.S. workforce in 1980 to more than 40 or 50 percent in leading cities and nations today.
454,Richard_Florida,2022-11-01 16:29:16+00:00,https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida/status/1587481911609511942,"9. Some 60 million Americans belong to the Creative Class, up from less than 40 million two decades, meaning they are directly employed and paid to work with their creativity in fields spanning arts and culture; science and innovation; and the knowledge-based professions."

What follows is probably not perfect as the numbers for faculty came from quick internet searches.  So worth it for others to nail this down. Once you do this the difference narrow a bit.

My hunch is the biggest impact of the pandemic will be to accentuate America's long standing demographic divide. Young ambitious people to big superstar cities. And then expanded choice for family formation stage beyond local suburbs to exurbs &amp; other metros, esp Sunbelt."

Sorry, the pandemic is not over, and many are still in the after-shock phase. People remains scared of transit, trains, offices &amp; cities. This fear factor will lessen as the pandemic ends."

Adaptive agent models we built of the emergence of evolution of the city system over time with Rob Axtell show much the same thing. Lots of churn &amp; disruption among 2nd and 3rd tier places. But incredible persistence at the top.

I'd caution folks about making grand statements about a whole new post-COVID geography. The economic and financial position of large global cities like NY is pretty persistent over time.

It is pretty clear that the pandemic put a premium on warm, outdoor places where families could get more space. And less COVID restrictions - ability to keep kids in school, socialize, etc. - also likely played a role."

This should not be all that surprising, and it suggests ""urbanization"" is still at work. It is not small tiny places sucking up all the growth.

But single-family or townhome will not be affordable for most in urban centers of global cities. So there’s still an issue. Also the interesting fact they luxury condo was out pricing single family in cities like New York and Toronto at least before the pandemic

Perhaps the biggest takeaway from this study is that the geographic variation in COVID-19 and the vulnerability of certain places to it appear to have relatively little to do with their own characteristics.

When it comes to place-based factors, our findings suggest that the geographic variation of COVID-19 is only weakly related to socio-economic factors, and even fewer of these variables are significantly directly related to deaths from COVID-19."

3403,Richard_Florida,2021-07-26 15:03:48+00:00,https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida/status/1419674820745252870,"18. This likely reflects the fact that younger people were free to have contact with one another because Sweden did not impose any lockdowns, while older and more vulnerable people were more likely to isolate and physically distance."

The variables for immigrants are positively and significantly associated with COVID-19.

The variables for income and education are positively related with COVID-19 cases at the municipal level, which seems counter-intuitive.  However, as in other studies, the variable for income inequality is positively associated with COVID-19."
3410,Richard_Florida,2021-07-26 15:00:55+00:00,https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida/status/1419674095768285186,11. Our findings for the variables for socio-economic status are mixed &amp; somewhat counter-intuitive.

3412,Richard_Florida,2021-07-26 14:58:40+00:00,https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida/status/1419673529272963076,8. Also significant is the timing of first infection.  Swedish cites &amp; neighborhoods that were hit earlier by the virus seem to have been hit harder (a finding which is in line with previous research).
3413,Richard_Florida,2021-07-26 14:57:53+00:00,https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida/status/1419673331738062853,7. Proximity matters: The factor that explains the most variation in our models is proximity to other places with higher rates of infection. This factor explains more than half of the variation in COVID-19 across Swedish cities.
3414,Richard_Florida,2021-07-26 14:57:17+00:00,https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida/status/1419673182869639169,"6. Overall, we find diffusion factors to be significantly more important than place-based factors in the spread of COVID-19 across Sweden."
3415,Richard_Florida,2021-07-26 14:56:24+00:00,https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida/status/1419672960349130757,"5. Our research examines COVID infections &amp; deaths across two geographic scales: all city-regions (municipalities) and neighborhoods in Sweden's 3 largest cities: Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. The data cover the initial wave of COVID infections, February-August 2020."

Sweden is a useful case study to examine the interplay these factors because it did not impose mandatory lockdowns and because there was little or no geographic variation in the pandemic restrictions or policies.

On a more minor and wonky note: the AmazonHQ2 bid  exposed the horrific inadequacy of Canadian locational data. And the inability to match it and compare it to US data which will handicap any future comparative location search efforts.

But any prolonged restrictions on global travel would seem to portend more serious consequences for global cities in small states with severe travel restrictions. What has been written on this?

For one, the US is a big country, with a huge market, &amp; a lot of cities - a well articulated spatial division of labor. Americans don't travel as much ...

If that is true, it says we are seeing the eclipse of so-called produced cities for cities of amenity and talent attraction.

A few thoughts on cities &amp; economic development in a COVID-19 &amp; Post-COVID-19 world. Much of the discussion has been abt location (of work &amp; residence) &amp; which cities or types of places (cities vs suburbs) are gaining or declining.

(1) Silicon Valley proper (the San Jose metro) has been losing VC investment share for sometime. Last time I looked was far behind San Francisco but also NY &amp; Boston-Cambridge. (2) @IanHathaway finds little pandemic induced shift in angel investing
